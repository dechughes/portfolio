<h2>About this crate</h2>

<p>
  This interactive crate is a personal project based on the Soulquarians - an informal name given to a loose collective of musicians that formed around Questlove, D’Angelo, James Poyser and J Dilla. Often described as a melting pot for musical experimentation, the artists working under this banner helped define the neo-soul movement and shaped the sound of soul, jazz and hip-hop in the late ’90s and early 2000s.
</p>

<p>
  I wanted to recreate some of the playful, exploratory feel of early internet design - sites like the original Space Jam website for the 1996 film (which also featured a great D’Angelo track on the soundtrack). They weren’t especially polished or commercial, but they felt like places where the creators wanted to offer something extra, rather than simply push content.
</p>

<p>
  I’ve always liked the idea of flicking through records, even though it was slightly before my time. There’s something appealing about picking up a record or a book you know nothing about, where the cover, the setting and a bit of curiosity do most of the work - rather than lists, rankings or recommendations.
</p>

<p>
  This is version one of the project. It’s mainly an experiment in UI and interaction, with a bit of storytelling mixed in. The aim was to make something that feels closer to a proper record shop visit, rather than just clicking through content.
