## **Cost Assumptions**

To model unit economics, the following assumptions were applied consistently:

| **Cost Type** | **Assumption** |
|---------------|----------------|
| Payment processing fee | 3% of payment value |
| Logistics cost per order | £5.00 |
| Customer acquisition cost (CAC) | £15.00 per customer |
| Fixed annual platform costs | £2,000,000 |

These assumptions are illustrative but grounded in typical marketplace cost structures.  
The intent is to assess **structural sustainability**, not produce a precise financial model.

## **Per‑Order Economics**

| **Metric** | **Value** |
|------------|-----------|
| Average order value | £160.99 |
| Payment processing cost (3%) | £4.83 |
| Logistics cost per order | £5.00 |
| **Total variable cost per order** | **£9.83** |
| **Contribution margin per order** | **£151.16** |
| Contribution margin (%) | 93.9% |

The per‑order margin is strong. After variable fulfilment costs, more than **93%** of order value is retained.  
This indicates the business is **not constrained by transactional economics** - each order is highly profitable on its own terms.

## **Per‑Customer Economics**

| **Metric** | **Value** |
|------------|-----------|
| Average revenue per customer | £160.99 |
| Average orders per customer | 1.035 |
| Total logistics cost per customer | £5.18 |
| Total processing cost per customer | £4.83 |
| **Total variable cost before CAC** | **£10.01** |
| **Contribution before CAC** | **£150.98** |
| Customer acquisition cost | £15.00 |
| **Net contribution per customer** | **£135.98** |

Even with very low retention, each acquired customer contributes **~£136** after all variable costs including CAC.  
Acquisition cost is **not a limiting factor** at current levels.  
First‑order economics alone are profitable, meaning the model scales as long as acquisition efficiency is maintained.

## **One‑Time vs Repeat Customer Economics**

| **Customer Type** | **Revenue** | **Total Costs** | **Net Contribution** |
|-------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| One‑time | £161.82 | £24.85 | ~£136.97 |
| Repeat | £314.99 | £34.45 | ~£280.54 |

Repeat customers are **more than twice as profitable** as one‑time customers.

With only **3.12%** of customers returning, even modest improvements in retention would significantly increase:

- contribution per acquired user  
- total platform profitability  
- marketing efficiency  

Retention is therefore a **leverage point**, not a survival requirement.  
The business is viable at current retention levels, but **far more profitable** with higher repeat rates.

## **Platform‑Level Contribution**

| **Metric** | **Value** |
|------------|-----------|
| Total revenue | £16,008,872 |
| Total processing costs (3%) | ~£480,000 |
| Total logistics costs | ~£497,000 |
| **Total variable costs** | **~£977,000** |
| **Contribution before CAC** | **~£15,030,000** |
| Total CAC (96,095 × £15) | ~£1,441,000 |
| **Estimated platform contribution** | **~£13,590,000** |

At a platform level, the business generates a substantial contribution before fixed costs.  
Subtracting fixed costs of **£2,000,000** still leaves an estimated operating surplus of **~£11.6m** over the period.

This is a **modelled estimate**, not a precise financial statement.

## **Break‑Even Illustration**

Using the per‑order contribution of **£151.16** and fixed annual costs of **£2,000,000**:

- **Break‑even order volume:** ~13,233 orders per year  
- The platform processed **over 99,000 orders**, indicating it operates well above break‑even on a variable‑cost basis
- **Break‑even customer number:** ~14,708 orders per year

## **Structural Interpretation**

Despite structural weaknesses:

- **3.12% repeat rate**  
- **85% of revenue concentrated among the top 10% of sellers**  

…the marketplace demonstrates:

- strong order‑level margins  
- healthy customer‑level contribution  
- scalable acquisition economics  

The platform’s challenge is **not financial margin** — margins are healthy.  
The challenge is **structural**:

- demand is shallow due to low retention  
- supply is concentrated among a small elite of sellers  

This creates fragility beneath an otherwise strong‑looking set of unit economics.
