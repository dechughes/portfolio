## **Seller Base Overview**

To evaluate seller economics, revenue was linked to the `order_items` table via `order_id`, allowing each seller to be associated with:

- total revenue generated  
- total orders fulfilled  

| **Metric** | **Value** |
|------------|-----------|
| Total sellers | 3,095 |
| Average revenue per seller | £6,561.59 |
| Minimum revenue generated by a seller | £12.22 |
| Maximum revenue generated by a seller | £507,166.91 |

The supply base is broad, with **3,095 sellers** active across the period. However, revenue distribution is highly uneven. The top seller generates **£507k**, almost **80× the average**, signalling heavy concentration within the seller base.

## **Revenue Concentration: Top 10% of Sellers**

| **Metric** | **Value** |
|------------|-----------|
| Revenue generated by top 10% of sellers | £13.64m |
| Share of total platform revenue | **85.19%** |

The seller analysis reveals **extreme revenue concentration**.  
The top **10% of sellers generate 85.19%** of all platform revenue.

This is both a **strength and a risk**:

- High‑performing sellers drive strong results  
- But over‑dependence on a small group creates fragility  

If even a handful of top sellers reduce activity or leave the platform, revenue would drop sharply. Strengthening the mid‑tier seller base would improve resilience.

## **Order Volume Distribution**

A Pareto analysis of order volume by seller makes the structure unmistakably clear:

- The cumulative contribution curve rises steeply at the start  
- A small number of sellers fulfil a disproportionate share of orders  
- The long tail of sellers contributes only marginally  

Most sellers complete a small number of orders, and contribution drops off rapidly.  
This reinforces the **concentration risk** identified in the revenue analysis.

## **Top 10 Sellers**

| **Seller ID** | **Total Revenue** | **Total Orders** |
|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 7c67e1448b... | £507,166.91 | 982 |
| 1025f0e2d4... | £308,222.04 | 915 |
| 54a3ca9315b... | £301,245.27 | 1,806 |
| 1f50f92017... | £290,253.42 | 1,404 |
| 53243585a1... | £284,903.08 | 358 |
| da8622b14e... | £272,219.32 | 1,314 |
| 4869f7a5df... | £264,166.12 | 1,132 |
| 955fee9216... | £236,322.30 | 1,287 |
| fa1c13f261... | £206,513.23 | 585 |
| 7e93a43ef3... | £185,134.21 | 336 |

Notably, some high‑revenue sellers operate on **modest order volumes**.  
For example:

- The 5th‑ranked seller generates **£284k** across only **358 orders**  
- This implies a **very high average order value**  

Variation in pricing and product mix means revenue concentration cannot be explained by volume alone - some sellers hold meaningful pricing power.

## **Structural Marketplace Assessment**

Combining customer and seller analyses reveals a clear structural picture:

### **Demand Side**
- Broad but shallow  
- Many customers, almost none return  
- Growth depends on continuous acquisition  

### **Supply Side**
- Narrow but dominant  
- A small group of sellers generates most revenue  
- High concentration risk  

This creates a **fragile marketplace structure**:

- Revenue depends on **constant new customer acquisition**  
- Stability depends on **continued activity of a small elite group of sellers**  

Both dependencies increase platform risk and limit long‑term resilience.
