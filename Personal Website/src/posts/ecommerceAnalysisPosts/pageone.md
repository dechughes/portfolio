# **Brazil E‑Commerce Marketplace Analysis: SQL‑Driven Commercial & Unit Economics Modelling**

## **Project Overview**

After completing *The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp: Go from SQL Beginner to Expert* on Udemy, I wanted to apply what I’d learned in a way that felt genuinely commercial - not just technical. My goal was to build a portfolio project that tested my SQL skills, my analytical thinking, and my ability to extract meaningful insights from real‑world data.

The **Olist Brazilian E‑Commerce dataset** is well‑suited for this. It mirrors the complexity of an actual marketplace business: multiple sellers, thousands of customers, diverse product categories, logistics constraints, and real customer behaviour. Rather than treating it as a simple data‑cleaning or dashboard exercise, I reframed the project as a **commercial performance and unit economics analysis**.

This project is designed to show that I can move from raw data to meaningful business insight - not just write queries.

## **The Business Framing**

Olist is a Brazilian marketplace that connects sellers to customers across multiple sales channels. The dataset covers approximately **100,000 orders** placed between 2016 and 2018, giving a clear window into the commercial lifecycle of a growing marketplace business.

I approached this the way an analyst embedded in the business would: starting with the data structure, validating its integrity, then building up to commercial interpretation. The questions I set out to answer are ones that would appear on a real business review agenda.

## **Key Commercial Questions**

### **Revenue & Volume**
- What is the total revenue across the period?  
- How does revenue trend month to month?  
- What is the average order value, and how is it distributed?

### **Customer Behaviour**
- What percentage of customers make repeat purchases?  
- Is revenue concentrated among a small group of customers?

### **Seller Economics**
- Which sellers generate the most revenue?  
- Is the marketplace dependent on a small number of sellers?

### **Unit Economics**
- What is the contribution margin per order and per customer?  
- How do one‑time and repeat customers compare on profitability?  
- What does break‑even look like at a platform level?
