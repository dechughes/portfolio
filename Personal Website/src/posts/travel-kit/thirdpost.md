How to valdiate a market

This is the question that I need to confirm before commiting anymore money - after designing the packging I made the overconfident mistakte of buying tins and the medicine which i think would be useufl rather than valdiating if there was even a market for it.

Defiently a lesson to be learnt from this

Not to mention the Shopify website I designed for this....

It might be telling me something in terms of if I want to design stuff, just dream or do I actually want to launch a business, or do I like the thought of what a business may bring me (purpose, my own creation, potential monetary freedom and time freedom down the line)

Defiently some questions to answer but for now I will make an effort of trying to validate this idea

If there is no market well at least I have experience in Figma, Shopify, sourcing, design and even the bsuiness creation process and how important it is to test a product before jumping the shark.
