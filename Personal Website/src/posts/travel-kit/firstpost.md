*Post 01 — Problem*

Whenever anyone talks about travelling, especially across South East Asia, when you ask *“What should I pack?”*, the first, second, or third item is always Imodium — or anti-shit-yourself medicine.

Now, being the spontaneous, unprepared, and overly optimistic traveller that I am, I assumed the kind of issues that would require such a thing were something I’d never require. After all, everyone else is just careless and unlucky.

This optimism has, of course, come back to bite me.

When you're inflicted with this particular curse, the *adventure* from the hostel to whatever vaguely disguised pharmacy you can find is like walking a tightrope, except the fear of dropping is more internal.

When I finally stumbled across one of these back-alley pharmacopeias, it might as well have been a witch’s shack. I couldn't decipher a single brew or pill.

Reading the literature online does little to inspire confidence. Finding out you’re meant to ingest charcoal - alongside a cabinet of other remedies - just to ensure your last pair of pants aren’t completely eviscerated the next time you find yourself vertical, isn’t reassuring.

The question I keep coming back to is whether there’s a better answer to this.

Is there a travel-ready kit for belly / stomach / arse issues that contains the right medicines (so I don’t have to forage for five separate items), tells me how much I should and shouldn’t take, tracks what I’ve already taken (my field research suggests that five Imodiums ensure you won’t be seeing porcelain - or a hole - for close to a week), and comes in an airport-OK container I can just chuck into my bag?

I will find out ...
