When looking on Amazon I'm seeing a lot of Pill Box Organisers - with lots of purchasers as well.

I'm not convinced that there is a market for this. 

When searching for such a thing the majority of results are for pill organsiers and general health kits rather than anything tailored towards a single ailement. 

I must admit it would be a pain in the arse to have to buy and bring a different kit for every ailment you encounter, further the question is that most people would proabbly buy imodium, paracetomol, bug spray and other versions of this essential rather than a kit that looks premium and allows you to keep track.

The one redeeming bit of light is that the options that do this kind of thing are extremely expensive (Although medically verified) tney offer everything under the moon rather than target a smaller niche, further you either see a product with no evident packaging or a very shit ziplock bag. 

I need to validate further to confirm if there is a real market for this and I'm just too lazy to buy imodum and paacetomol when i travel. 

For my sake I wanted to learn Figma and see if I could design a tracker and a front cover for this product so I will put that in another post as a mock-up for the idea of this product - even if its not one that going to sell it was fun to stretch my design skills and use the apparel maker https://www.grazianoandgutierrez.com/ as an influence (i like their style)
