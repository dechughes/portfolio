I have been working on this project in a backwards, not-so sensible fashion that has definetly taught me a lesson about testing the demand from a market rather than going ahead on vibes and dreams alone...


I decided to start designing a v1 for this project - asking a typical VCombinator Q - what would the MVP look like? - intended to test demand and see if there is potential for this idea 

Typical to me (and a lesson i hope to learn) is that I jump the shark, thinking it will have market just because I had the problem and my inner circle also had the problem 

ALthough these are bad buisness mistakes they have allowed me to learn Figma, Shopify and small business sourcing and actually producing a live product. That goes a lot further than my other ideas and sets my baseline for a business higher than it previously was so its not all bad.


My first ideas for design wanted to emulate the design of them old sardine/shoe polish/vintage tins which contain all the essentials in a compact, sturdy, functional and easy to use.


My first sketches included having a book design within the tin so taht each medicine could be easily distinguished and would also contain the required medication instructions.
